# Interesting online config for inspiration

## Ideas of configurations:

- [x] make a command to move from code block next/previous in quarto file
- [ ] make window borders a bit more obvious. 
- [ ] Have the non-active windows of a slightly altered shade
- [ ] improve the "six" method to send code block to REPL bringing back the cursor to th same position
- [ ] make the "six" method work while being in insert mode too.
